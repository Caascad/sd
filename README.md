Caascad Registry
================
The registry is the object where we store runtime values necessary for service discovery purposes.
We can store there multiple type of informations:
 * public ip addresses instances
 * loadbalancers instances
 * ?

The service used to store those objects is AWS dynamoDB. The service let us store arbitraries maps in it. The only constraints is to provide a primary key in this hash.
DynamoDB tables can be queried by complex requests, or fully scanned to retrieve the whole table.

The aim of the current repository is to provide cuelang schemes to describe any objects that could be found in the registry.

Primary key
-----------
The primary key configured for the dynamodb table is a uuid. This uuid can be simply generated by commands like uuidgen.
